A type in Next is essentially the following tuple :
`(<module_name>, <class_name>)`
Each class declares a new type. There are several primitive types available in 
Next, they are :
1. number
2. bool
3. string

More primitive types may be added later. Primitive types do not reserve any 
keywords in Next. Types are only useful in `catch` blocks, or in typed methods 
(if and when they come in Next).
